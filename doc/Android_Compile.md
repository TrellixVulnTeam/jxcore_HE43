JXcore is ready for `Android OS`. On this tutorial, we will give you step-by-step instruction on how to compile JXcore for Android target.

First, you need `Android NDK`. You can download the latest NDK from [here](https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html)

Assuming you have already extracted `Android NDK` into `~/androidNDK` folder, next step is to use our prebuilt script file to create Android toolchains before the compilation process.

Before starting, please check the **prerequisites** from [this link](https://github.com/jxcore/jxcore/blob/master/doc/HOW_TO_COMPILE.md)

Go to root folder of jxcore project and;
```bash
$> build_scripts/android-configure.sh ~/androidNDK/
```
This should create `android-toolchain` and `android-toolchain-intel` folders under the project's root folder. We need this folders to prepare Android ARM, MIPS and Intel binaries. 

### Compile as a Standalone Process

```bash
$> build_scripts/android_standalone.sh ~/androidNDK/ intel sm
```
Instead of 'intel' you can also set 'arm' for ARM target. sm symbolizes Spider Monkey, for V8 engine set 'v8'

When the compilation is completed, you can find the 'jx' binary is available under `out_android` folder.

### Compile as a Static Library

Now we can compile jxcore for android. type;
```bash
$> build_scripts/android_compile.sh ~/androidNDK/
```

The previous script uses SpiderMonkey, if you want/need V8, please use android_compile_v8.sh instead.

This one should take a while. When it's finished, you can find the binaries and include files for ARM and INTEL platforms inside `out_android/android` folder.
